Title or name of research/training - Refactoring with React Navigation.
Why - To better organize our code so that we can navigate screen to screen. Currently everything is jumbled up in app.js and hard to merge our teams code. 
What I expect to learn/do - I expect to learn how to refactor our app.js to include navigators with the use of a stack navigator in order to move between different screens by components. 
What do I expect with it - I believe once this is done and I implement a new UI for my team we should have an easier time with contributions by developing split up forms of components.
What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training. - Creating react navigation and linking the login UI to a component.
